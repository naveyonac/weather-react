# React Weather Application

The goal of this application is to pull in the local weather for the user based on their zip code, then give them clothing reccommendations based in their input and the weather for that day. Ultimately the user could use the app to plan their packing based on the weather for wherever they are traveling to.

## Technologies used

This application was built using:
JavaScript
React

### MVP

The MVP for this application is I want the user to be able to enter in their zip code and have the API search for the location and bring back the name of the city, the current temp, the humidity, and a brief description of the weather.

### Bronze

My Bronze goal for the app is to have the user be able to sign up and log in and be able to save specific zip codes for future references.

### Silver

The silver goal is for the user to be able to save a collection of all of their clothes. Based on their clothing and the weather, the application will give clothing selections for the user.

### Gold

Going for gold, the user will be able to look out in advance and be able to plan what to bring on trips. There will be a date selector(the user might put in "april 20-22") and zip code input. The app will then see what the weather will be like for those dates in that location and based on that, will tell you what clothing you should bring.(If its supposed to rain it will mention an umbrella or rain jacket, if its warm will advise bringing shorts or maybe some swim trunks)
